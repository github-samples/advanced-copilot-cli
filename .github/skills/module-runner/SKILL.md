  Simulate a learner running an advanced-copilot-cli course module end-to-end. Read a module from content/NN-*.md, execute every learner step in order on the machine where the skill runs, run every command and prompt individually, verify outcomes, and write findings to issues/NN-issues.md. Can also build or refresh a module's official solution branch by driving a real Copilot CLI instance with the module's own prompts. Can also run non-interactively as a deterministic validator/seed engine invoked by an external branch generator to regenerate and verify per-module state.
  USE FOR: run a module, test a module, validate a course module, simulate a student, learner walkthrough, find module issues, run module steps, build a solution branch, refresh a solution branch by driving Copilot CLI, validate or seed a start-of-module-N branch, run as a non-interactive validator invoked by CI or an external generator.
  DO NOT USE FOR: editing course content without running it, generic code review, running Azure agentic journeys, or static-only content review.

# Module Runner

Run an `advanced-copilot-cli` course module exactly like a learner would. The goal is not to skim the lesson or judge it from the Markdown. The goal is to perform the module step by step on the current machine, capture evidence, and report any learner-blocking issues.

## Required behavior

When this skill is invoked in this repository, you must:

1. Identify the target module in `content/`. If the user named a module, use that file. If the user did not name one, use the active or tagged module when available. If there is still no clear module, ask for the module file.
2. Extract the module number from the file name prefix, such as `03` from `content/03-test-suite-remote-delegation.md`.
3. Create a dedicated run workspace under `module-runs/<module-number>-<module-slug>-<timestamp>/` before executing any learner action.
4. Detect and enter the learner project's devcontainer environment before running learner commands when the project provides `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
5. Read the module from top to bottom and build a learner execution plan from headings, numbered steps, fenced code blocks, prompts, expected outcomes, notes, warnings, and summary checks.
6. Execute each learner step in document order. Do not skip steps because they look manual, obvious, or already understood.
7. Run every command, prompt, or required action individually on the machine where the skill runs, inside the learner devcontainer when one is available.
8. Verify the expected result before moving to the next step.
9. Record any issue in `issues/<module-number>-issues.md`, for example `issues/03-issues.md`.

Static review alone is a failed run. If a step cannot be performed, record the reason as an issue with evidence instead of pretending it passed.

## Module format in this repo

Course modules live in `content/` and use numbered file names such as `content/03-test-suite-remote-delegation.md`. The H1 usually starts with a module title, exercises use `## Exercise: ...`, and learner substeps often use `### Phase ...` plus numbered lists. Code fences are meaningful:

- `bash` fences are shell commands the learner runs.
- `text` fences often contain Copilot CLI prompts, slash commands, URLs, or expected output.
- Other language fences may contain code a learner is expected to create, inspect, or compare.

Treat the module text, not assumptions from another course, as the source of truth.

## Execution rules

### Dedicated run workspace

Every run must keep the course repo, run evidence, and learner workspace separate:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Course root | The `advanced-copilot-cli` repository where `content/` is read and `issues/<module-number>-issues.md` is written. |
| Run root | `module-runs/<module-number>-<module-slug>-<timestamp>/`, the preserved review folder for this simulation. |
| Learner root | `module-runs/<module-number>-<module-slug>-<timestamp>/learner-workspace/`, the working directory where learner commands, prompts, file edits, installs, app runs, tests, and generated artifacts happen. |

Create the run root before executing learner steps. Inside it, keep review artifacts:

```text
module-runs/<module-number>-<module-slug>-<timestamp>/
├── learner-workspace/
├── logs/
│   ├── commands.md
│   ├── prompts.md
│   └── transcript.md
└── artifacts/
```

Do not run learner commands from the course root unless the module explicitly says the learner should work in the course repository. The course root is for reading module content and writing the issue report.

If the module names a target learner repository, such as the Module 3 instruction to open an AssetTrack repository created from the `github-samples/contoso-inventory` template, clone or copy that repository into `learner-workspace/` and run the module there. Prefer a fresh clone or copy so the complete resulting state is preserved for review. If the target repository, repository URL, branch, or credentials are not available, stop before the first dependent learner step and record a missing-prerequisite or external-service blocker in the issue report.

### Solution-branch catch-up setup

A jump-in learner catches up by checking out the `start-of-module-N` catch-up branch on the `github-samples/contoso-inventory` template repository, not by running an asset script. `start-of-module-N` holds the cumulative end state of every module before `N` (so `start-of-module-03` is the state a learner has after finishing Module 2). The template hosts `start-of-module-02` through `start-of-module-07`; there is no `start-of-module-01`, because Module 1 starts from the pristine fork's default branch. Read the module's catch-up instructions to confirm the exact branch name.

The older `NN-<slug>-solution` branch names are kept as frozen deprecated aliases and still resolve: `02-building-ai-infra-solution` aliases `start-of-module-03`, and `03-test-suite-remote-delegation-solution` aliases `start-of-module-04`. Prefer the `start-of-module-N` name; treat an alias in older content as equivalent.

When a module depends on a catch-up branch for a valid test run, get onto that branch after the learner repository is cloned or copied and before dependency install, devcontainer setup, Copilot prompts, app startup, commits, pushes, or delegation.

If you create the learner repository from the template with `gh repo create --template`, pass `--include-all-branches` so the catch-up branches come along, then check out the branch for the target module (Module 3 shown):

```bash
git -C learner-workspace/<repo> checkout start-of-module-03
```

If the catch-up branch is not present in the learner repository, fetch it from the template repository into a local branch first:

```bash
git -C learner-workspace/<repo> fetch https://github.com/github-samples/contoso-inventory start-of-module-03:start-of-module-03
git -C learner-workspace/<repo> checkout start-of-module-03
```

Record the catch-up branch, commands, and output in `logs/commands.md` and `logs/transcript.md`. If the required branch is unavailable, record a missing-prerequisite blocker and stop before the first dependent learner step.

### GitHub template repository setup

Some modules depend on a learner-owned repository created from a GitHub template, such as Module 0's AssetTrack repository created from `github-samples/contoso-inventory`. If the user provides the upstream template repository, a wrong repository, or no writable learner repository, you may offer to create a temporary learner repository from the template with GitHub CLI.

Template repository creation is an external GitHub side effect. Before running `gh repo create --template`, ask for explicit approval with the target owner, repository name, visibility, and cleanup expectation. Do not create, push to, delegate from, or delete a GitHub repository without explicit user approval.

When approved, use a unique repository name that includes the module number and timestamp, unless the user provides a name. Record the template source, created repository URL, visibility, command output, and cleanup expectation in `logs/transcript.md` and `logs/commands.md`. Clone the created repository into `learner-workspace/` and run the module from that clone. If creation fails because of permissions, naming conflicts, missing authentication, organization policy, or unavailable template access, record an external-service blocker and stop before dependent learner steps.

Keep `module-runs/` after the run finishes. Do not delete or overwrite it. Include the run root path in `issues/<module-number>-issues.md` so reviewers can inspect the final learner workspace, logs, and artifacts.

### Devcontainer-first execution

This course's green path is Codespaces. AssetTrack is expected to run in the target project's devcontainer, not directly on the host machine. If the learner project has `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, run learner commands and Copilot prompts inside that devcontainer unless the module explicitly says to use the host.

Use this order:

1. If already running inside the target learner repo's Codespace or devcontainer, use that environment and record the container evidence in `logs/transcript.md`.
2. If Docker and the Dev Containers CLI are available, build or start the devcontainer for the learner root, then run each learner command through the devcontainer execution surface.
3. If the Dev Containers CLI is unavailable but VS Code devcontainers or Codespaces controls are available, use that supported surface and record exactly how commands were run.
4. If no devcontainer execution surface is available, stop before dependency or app-start steps that rely on the container toolchain and record an environment blocker. Do not fall back to host execution for Java, Node, Python, .NET, Maven, Playwright, or app startup unless the user explicitly authorizes a local-host fallback.

When using the Dev Containers CLI, prefer this pattern from the course repo host:

```bash
devcontainer up --workspace-folder <learner-root>
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder <learner-root> <command>
```

Run each learner command separately. For example, run `devcontainer exec --workspace-folder <learner-root> npm install`, then `devcontainer exec --workspace-folder <learner-root> npm run install:all`, then start `npm run dev` in a controlled devcontainer process.

Record devcontainer setup separately from module steps. Devcontainer setup failures are environment blockers unless the module or target project contains a broken devcontainer definition.

### Step-by-step learner mode

Execute the module as a learner:

1. Before each step, identify the current heading, line reference, learner action, expected result, working directory, and whether the step changes files or external state.
2. Perform exactly that action.
3. Capture the result: command, prompt, tool used, exit code or observable outcome, and a short output excerpt.
4. Compare the result to the module's stated expectation.
5. Continue to the next step unless the current step blocks the rest of the module.

Do not combine separate learner steps. Do not batch separate commands with `&&` to save time. If the module itself shows a single command line that contains `&&`, run that line as written.

### Shell commands

For each `bash` fence:

1. Run each standalone command line individually in the documented order.
2. Run commands from the learner root by default, not the course root.
3. If the learner project has a devcontainer, run commands inside it by default.
4. Preserve the learner's working directory between commands when the module tells the learner to `cd`.
5. For multi-line commands that use continuation characters, run the continued command as one command.
6. For install commands, run the exact install command unless it is destructive or requires missing credentials.
7. For validation commands, record pass or fail with the actual output.

For dev servers such as `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `dotnet watch`, or similar:

1. Start the server in a controlled background process.
2. Wait until it is actually reachable or ready.
3. Run the verification steps against the running server.
4. Stop the exact process or session when the module no longer needs it.

### Copilot CLI prompts and slash commands

When the module tells the learner to start Copilot CLI and send a prompt:

1. Treat the prompt as an instruction to the current agent session unless the user explicitly asks you to spawn a nested Copilot CLI.
2. Execute the requested work as the learner would, including file edits, command runs, and follow-up verification.
3. Run the follow-up command in the module before deciding the prompt succeeded.

When the module includes slash commands such as `/remote`, `/delegate`, `/agent`, or `/keep-alive`:

1. Attempt the command only through the real Copilot CLI surface available in the current environment.
2. If the slash command cannot be executed from the current skill context, record a blocked or environment issue with the exact command and why it could not be run.
3. Do not replace a slash-command exercise with a conceptual explanation.

### Manual, browser, and external-service steps

Manual learner actions still need execution evidence:

- For browser steps, open or probe the stated URL with available browser automation, HTTP checks, or the environment's browser tooling. Confirm the expected page or UI state.
- For GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, Codespaces, remote control, delegation, or pull request review steps, use `gh`, browser automation, or available Copilot CLI features when possible.
- If credentials, a GUI, mobile device, or external approval are unavailable, record the step as blocked with enough detail for a human to reproduce it.

Do not mark manual steps as passed unless you observed the required state.

### File edits and side effects

The module may instruct the learner to change an application or create files. Make those changes when the module requires them, because that is part of the learner simulation.

Do not edit the course module itself while running it unless the user explicitly asks for content fixes. The runner's job is to reveal issues, not silently repair the lesson.

For commits, pushes, cloud delegation, Azure deployment, paid resources, or other external side effects, proceed only when the current user invocation explicitly authorizes a full run that includes those side effects, or pause for approval. If approval is not available, record the step as blocked instead of skipping it silently.

## Solution-branch mode: build a module's solution by driving Copilot CLI

Use this mode when the user asks to build or refresh a module's produced state — the catch-up branch `start-of-module-(N+1)` that captures the end state of Module `N` (for example, running Module 2 produces `start-of-module-03`) — rather than only to find issues. The rule that makes this mode "real": do not hand-author the solution artifacts yourself. Drive a genuine Copilot CLI instance with the module's own prompts so the solution is actually Copilot-generated, then commit it. This mode reuses the devcontainer-first execution and catch-up-branch rules above, and still logs content problems to the issue report. For a fully automated, non-interactive run driven by an external generator, use the validator/seed mode described below instead.

### Set up the branch and environment

1. Clone the learner template repository, check out the module's catch-up branch `start-of-module-NN` (zero-padded two-digit, for example `start-of-module-04`; the `NN-<slug>-solution` aliases still resolve), then create the produced-state branch off it — the next module's zero-padded catch-up branch: `git checkout -b start-of-module-NN` (for example, running Module 4 produces `start-of-module-05`).
2. Bring up the project devcontainer (`devcontainer up --workspace-folder <learner-root>`) and verify the toolchains inside it. Run every command and every Copilot prompt through `devcontainer exec`. Never build, test, or generate on the bare host — the polyglot stacks (Java, .NET, Python, Node, Maven, Playwright) usually only exist inside the container.

### Authenticate the nested Copilot CLI

The container's `copilot` must be authenticated, and the running agent cannot log in on the user's behalf. `gh` is usually not installed in the container, so `gh auth login` will not work there.

1. Ask the user to authenticate once themselves so their token never appears in command logs: they open a container shell (`devcontainer exec --workspace-folder <learner-root> bash`), run `copilot`, then `/login` (device flow). Auth persists in the container's `~/.copilot/`.
2. Verify before proceeding with a trivial headless prompt: `copilot -p "Reply with exactly: AUTH_OK" --model <model> --allow-all`.

### Drive Copilot with the module's exact prompts

1. Run each module prompt non-interactively: `copilot -p "<verbatim module prompt>" --model <model> --allow-all`. `--allow-all` (or at least `--allow-all-tools`) is required for non-interactive tool use.
2. Chain steps in one session for continuity with `--resume=<sessionId>`. The id prints at the end of each run as `Resume  copilot --resume=<id>`.
3. For agent steps, add `--agent <slug>` (for example `--agent accessibility-expert`), matching the module's `/agent` instruction.
4. Use the module's exact prompts, in order, and run the tests and commands the module specifies. When Copilot's generated tests fail or it abandons a required area, re-prompt with concrete guidance exactly as a stuck learner would, then re-run — do not silently hand-fix its output.

### Verify, then commit

1. Do not trust Copilot's success summary. Independently confirm every required deliverable exists and passes; Copilot will sometimes declare success while silently dropping required tests.
2. Commit the generated artifacts in the module's narrative order with a `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer (Copilot genuinely authored them). Keep the branch local; push, open a PR, or delegate only with explicit user approval.

### Runtime-only and cloud steps

- `/remote` is runtime-only and produces no committable files. Document it; do not fabricate an artifact.
- `/delegate` needs a pushed branch and the Copilot cloud agent (an asynchronous external PR). For a local-only solution branch, generate the delegated backfill with a local Copilot session as a documented stand-in, or push and delegate for real only with approval.

### What to watch for

These behaviors showed up when building the Module 3 solution branch and are worth anticipating:

- Copilot over-generates: expect multiple `*.spec.ts` files and extra `*.md` docs even when the module implies a single file. Constrain in the prompt if a tight solution is needed.
- Auto-generated scaffold or sample tests can be buggy (for example an ambiguous locator that fails Playwright strict mode) and muddy the module's "classify each failure" step.
- Briefs balloon: Copilot invents filenames, test counts, and success matrices. Constrain the prompt if you need the module's concise brief.
- Generated scaffolds often skip housekeeping the module expects, such as gitignoring `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`.
- Backend test isolation via a process-global environment variable (for example `ASSETS_DB_PATH`) can race under parallel test runners. Watch for intermittent failures and disable parallelization if needed.
- Inline `httpx.AsyncClient` context managers are hard for the agent to mock, and it may drop required tests. Hint the synchronous `TestClient` plus monkeypatched `httpx.AsyncClient` approach, or factor the calls into helpers.
- Log every module-content problem found this way to `issues/<module-number>-issues.md` (or the file the user names), the same as learner mode.

## Validator/seed mode: non-interactive invocation by an external generator

Use this mode when an external branch generator — the `github-samples/contoso-inventory` maintenance workflow — invokes module-runner in CI to regenerate and verify a module's produced state without a human in the loop. It is the same real execution as solution-branch mode (drive Copilot with the module's own prompts, verify against the module's own checks), but it runs unattended, confines all writes to declared paths, and emits a stable, machine-checkable result so the caller can gate on it.

This mode is the deterministic seed engine the contoso-inventory generator calls. The generated code may vary run to run because the model is probabilistic; determinism here means the **contract** is stable — fixed inputs, fixed output locations, a fixed result schema, stable commit messages, and a pass/fail decision derived from the module's own verification steps rather than from Copilot's self-report.

### Invocation contract (inputs)

The caller starts a single non-interactive Copilot CLI session on the runner and asks for module-runner in validator/seed mode. Recommended entrypoint:

```bash
copilot -p "Run module-runner in validator/seed mode with: mode=<validate|seed> module=<N> base-ref=<git-ref> acc-ref=<sha> repo=<path> out=<dir>" \
  --model <model> --allow-all --log-level error
```

The skill reads these named inputs from the invocation:

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mode` | `validate` runs and verifies without emitting a patch series; `seed` runs, verifies, and emits the produced-state delta for promotion. |
| `module` | Module number `1..7` whose content is executed. |
| `base-ref` | Git ref in the learner repo to start from, passed verbatim by the caller: the zero-padded two-digit branch `start-of-module-NN` for `module >= 2` (for example `start-of-module-04`, never `start-of-module-4`), or the pristine default branch / `acc-base` tag for `module == 1`. Consume this value as given; never reconstruct the branch name from an unpadded `module` number. |
| `acc-ref` | The `advanced-copilot-cli` commit SHA (or ref) to read the module content from. Checked out into the course root before the run. |
| `repo` | Path to the learner repo checkout (`contoso-inventory`) where learner steps execute. All learner writes stay inside this path. |
| `out` | Output directory for evidence, patches, and the result file. All review artifacts stay inside this path. |
| `model` | Optional model override; pin it when the caller wants reproducible generation attempts. |

The run must not write outside `repo` and `out` (plus `issues/` in the course root). It must not push, open PRs, or delegate; producing the delta is the generator's job to promote downstream.

### Determinism rules

1. Read the module from `acc-ref` exactly; never from working-tree edits.
2. Start from `base-ref` on a clean checkout; abort with a `BLOCKED` result if the base ref is missing or the tree is dirty.
3. Use stable, parameterized commit messages with no timestamps or volatile data:

   ```text
   chore(seed): module <N> produced-state for start-of-module-NN [acc:<acc-ref-short>]
   ```

   The `start-of-module-NN` branch name is zero-padded two-digit (Module 4 produces `start-of-module-05`).

   Keep the `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer, because Copilot authored the artifacts.
4. Emit patches with `git format-patch` in commit order so the series is reproducible and reviewable.
5. Derive the pass/fail decision only from the module's own verification steps (tests, required file paths, required commands) — never from Copilot's success summary.
6. Run fully non-interactively (`--allow-all`); if any step would need interactive input, credentials, or an unavailable external service, stop and record a `BLOCKED` result instead of guessing.
7. Confine writes to `repo` and `out`; leave the course root unchanged except for `issues/<NN>-issues.md`.

### Output contract

Write everything under `out`:

```text
<out>/
├── result.json          # machine-checkable summary (schema below)
├── patches/             # git format-patch series (seed mode only)
├── evidence/            # command logs, test output, tool results
└── issues/<NN>-issues.md
```

`result.json` is the machine-readable summary the caller gates on. Write it as the final action of every run, including failures:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "mode": "seed",
  "module": 2,
  "base_ref": "start-of-module-02",
  "acc_ref": "<full-40-char-acc-sha>",
  "produced_branch": "start-of-module-03",
  "result": "PASS",
  "patches": ["patches/0001-....patch"],
  "verification": [
    { "name": "playwright a11y suite", "command": "npm run test:e2e", "status": "pass" }
  ],
  "issues_report": "issues/02-issues.md",
  "started_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "finished_at": "<ISO-8601>"
}
```

`result` is one of `PASS` (produced state generated and every verification step passed), `FAIL` (a verification step failed), or `BLOCKED` (a prerequisite, credential, or external service prevented a valid run). In `validate` mode omit `patches` and `produced_branch`.

### Result and exit-code semantics

Because the skill runs inside a Copilot CLI session, `result.json` — not the process exit code of `copilot` — is the authoritative signal. The caller reads `result.json` and maps it to an exit code for its pipeline:

| `result.json` state | Recommended caller exit code |
|---|---|
| `result: "PASS"` | `0` |
| `result: "FAIL"` | `1` |
| `result: "BLOCKED"` | `2` |
| missing or unparseable `result.json` | `3` |

A minimal wrapper the generator can run in CI:

```bash
copilot -p "Run module-runner in validator/seed mode with: mode=seed module=$MODULE base-ref=$BASE_REF acc-ref=$ACC_SHA repo=$REPO out=$OUT" \
  --model "$MODEL" --allow-all --log-level error
node -e 'const r=require(process.env.OUT+"/result.json");process.exit(r.result==="PASS"?0:r.result==="FAIL"?1:2)' \
  || { [ -f "$OUT/result.json" ] || exit 3; }
```

### Evidence

Evidence requirements match learner and solution-branch modes: capture each command, prompt, exit status, and a short output excerpt under `evidence/`, and log every module-content problem to `issues/<NN>-issues.md`. The generator promotes the patch series and inspects `result.json` and the evidence; module-runner never promotes, pushes, or opens PRs itself.

## Issue reporting

Create the `issues/` directory if it does not exist. Always write `issues/<module-number>-issues.md` at the end of a run. If there are no issues, write a short report that says no issues were found and includes the executed scope.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Module <module-number> issues

Module: `content/<module-file>.md`
Run date: <ISO timestamp>
Run workspace: `module-runs/<module-number>-<module-slug>-<timestamp>/`
Result: PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL | BLOCKED

## Summary

<One short paragraph describing what was executed and the overall outcome.>

## Issues

### 1. <Issue title>

- Location: `<heading or line range>`
- Step: `<learner step text or code fence summary>`
- Classification: content bug | command failure | ambiguous instruction | missing prerequisite | environment blocker | expected result mismatch | external-service blocker
- Expected: `<what the module said or implied should happen>`
- Actual: `<what happened>`
- Evidence: `<command, exit code, output excerpt, URL, screenshot path, or tool result>`
- Suggested fix: `<specific course-content or setup change>`

## Commands and prompts executed

| Step | Location | Action | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `<heading>` | `<command or prompt summary>` | PASS |
```

Keep the issue file factual. Include enough evidence that a course author can reproduce the failure without rerunning the whole module.

## Classification guide

Use consistent classifications:

| Classification | Use when |
|---|---|
| content bug | The module gives an incorrect command, path, prompt, file name, or expected result. |
| command failure | A command from the module exits nonzero or cannot complete as written. |
| ambiguous instruction | A learner would not know what to do next or where to run a step. |
| missing prerequisite | The module assumes a tool, account, dependency, service, or repo state without telling the learner. |
| environment blocker | The local machine cannot perform a valid learner step, such as no browser UI or no required service. |
| expected result mismatch | The step runs, but the observed result does not match the module. |
| external-service blocker | The step needs GitHub.com, cloud agent, mobile, Azure, billing, or another service that is unavailable or unauthorized. |

## Completion criteria

A module run is complete only when:

1. Every executable learner step has been run or recorded as blocked.
2. Every command and prompt has a pass, fail, or blocked result.
3. Devcontainer use has been verified and recorded when the learner project provides one, or a blocker explains why devcontainer execution was unavailable.
4. Required generated files, apps, tests, servers, PRs, or delegated tasks have been verified when the module asks for them.
5. The run root under `module-runs/` exists and contains the final learner workspace, logs, and artifacts needed for review.
6. `issues/<module-number>-issues.md` exists and contains either issues or a no-issues report with the run workspace path.
7. Any background process started during the run has been stopped unless the user explicitly asked to leave it running.
